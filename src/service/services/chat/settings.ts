     * or a second laptop — where `localhost:5520` is simply nothing. The relay
     * binds 0.0.0.0:5520, so the LAN address works from anywhere on the network.

     * deployment MUST flip to `wss://` — browsers block ws:// from an https page as
     * mixed content. Behind nginx the public path is `/ws-keen`
     * (`wss://<host>/ws-keen`) rather than `:5520/ws`.

     * destroys the upgrade socket and the WS closes 1006 with no explanation.
